# Word-Guess-Game


* This project is practice for javascript including looping through arrays, randomization, and user interaction.

* It is based on the game hangman
    * Users are given a picture of an anime character and must recall or guess what the name of the character is one letter at a time
    * Users win if they can identify all characters
    * They lose if they run out of tries
