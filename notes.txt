* Features (name that anime character)
	* Picks a name randomly from a predefined list of strings stored in an array
	* Ask for input from user and append the input to a array of previously tried values:
		* If the character is in the string: do nothing
		* Else
			* Check if the character is in the string using "in"
				* if it does increment subscore
					* if subscore reaches len(name) you win.
				* Otherwise, decrement the number of guesses left
					*if guessesLeft reaches 0 you lose.


* THINGS TO IMPROVE
	* play that character's theme
	* Difficulties(aim for 15 in each easy,medium,hard)
	* Code cleanup/compression
